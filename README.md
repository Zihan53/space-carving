# space-carving

This project demonstrates the 3D reconstruction technique known as Space Carving. I use two datasets, the Bunny and the Dino, to showcase the reconstruction results.

## Bunny Dataset
The Bunny dataset is sourced from [TUM Computer Vision Group](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/data/datasets/3dreconstruction).
